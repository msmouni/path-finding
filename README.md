# Pathfinding visualization

This project is an implementation of the following pathfinding algorithms:
* BFS (Breadth-First Search)
* Dijkstra
* A*
It visualizes on a graph represented by a tile-based map the process of finding a path between a start tile and an end tile. It also allows to compare the performance of the implemented algorithms.

# Platformer adaptation

This project also includes an adaptation of pathfinding algorithms for movement on a platform, which can therefore be used in platformer games.
